# taste
R code to prepare and process sensory analysis (taste the difference between food-products using an trinagle test and other)

## Learn Data Science with beer

**Basic Question**: can you taste the difference between "GÃ¶sser" and "Ottakringer" (Austrian beer brands)

**Experimental Design**: first taste and rate each beer unblinded (you know what you are drinken). Then test if any differnece can be detected in a double blinded test (trinagle test: one out ouf three is diffrent, try to find out which one?)

**Data Collection**: Beer testing took place at the end of the VDSG Cafe IV in March 2018. A questionnaire was used. Ratings are coded as numbers from 1 to 5 (e.g. 1 = taste bad, 5 = taste very good). Yes/No answers are coded as 1/0.
